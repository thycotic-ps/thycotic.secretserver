<h1 align="center">Thycotic.SecretServer PowerShell Module</h1>
<p></p>

## Purpose

This module provides a secure method that Secret Server Administrators and Users can use for managing and automating their environment. Scripts and automated processing that requires a privileged (or non-privileged) account have to be stored somewhere. Why store them in plaintext within a script or in an XML file that only uses DPAPI encryption (`SecureString > Export-Clixml`)?

Secret Server provides a management tool for those privileged accounts. Thycotic.SecretServer module allows you to access those accounts securely and utilize them in your scripts and automation in a secure manner.

## Classes

The module utilizes C# based classes to provide a unique object and type with each endpoint. In addition, certain classes may include Methods that provide "shortcuts" for performing specific actions in PowerShell or manipulating the object output by a function.

Documentation for the classes can be found on the documentation site here: [about topics](https://thycotic-ps.github.io/thycotic.secretserver/about_topics/)

### Library Build

The source code for the library is found in the `src\Thycotic.SecretServer` folder. This project utilizes [InvokeBuild](https://powershellgallery.com/packages/InvokeBuild) to build the library.

If you would like to locally debug the project for contributing or your purpose, clone the repository and then run the following command:

> You will need PowerShell 7 installed for this process!

```powershell
# Install the InvokeBuild module if not already
Install-Module InvokeBuild

# build the library
Invoke-Build -File .\build.ps1 -Configuration Debug
```
