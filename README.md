# Introduction

Welcome to the Thycotic Secret Server PowerShell module. This module utilizes the REST API to allow you to manage things in Secret Server. This module is managed and maintained by Thycotic Professional Services.

The goal of the module is to be able to have a similar workflow as the UI, but also to make things easier for users to interact and write automation scripts that utilize the REST API of Secret Server.

A [quick start guide](https://github.com/thycotic-ps/thycotic.secretserver/wiki) can be found in the Wiki of this repository to provide some context around the basic use of the module.

# Changelog

A formal change log is provided in the repository ([CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)), and will be included with each GitHub release.

# Installation

Recommended method will be via the module published to the PowerShell Gallery. However a few alternatives are also available:

- Download each release from GitHub [here](https://github.com/thycotic-ps/thycotic.secretserver/releases)
- Download latest release via Thycotic download link (_coming soon_)

To install via the PowerShell Gallery the latest release of [PowerShellGet module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget) will be needed. The module is in beta release at this time, so `-AllowPreRelease` will be required for both `Find-Module` and `Install-Module`. _This requires being on version 2.0.0 or greater of PowerShellGet._

# Documentation

Each function includes comment-based help, as well as `about_` topics for the classes used. A public docs web site is in progress.
