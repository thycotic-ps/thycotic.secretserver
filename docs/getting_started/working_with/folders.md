# Examples

## Create a single, root Folder

This will create a new folder under All Secrets folder (-1) named `A root folder`. The user used in the call will be the only one that has access to this folder once created.

```powershell
Import-Module Thycotic.SecretServer

$sessionParams = @{
    SecretServer = 'http://prod/SecretServer'
    Credential = Get-Credential
}
$session = New-TssSession @sessionParams

New-TssFolder -TssSession $session -FolderName 'A root folder' -Verbose
```

### Output

```console
PowerShell credential request
Enter your credentials.
User: ssadmin
Password for user ssadmin: ********

VERBOSE: Provided command parameters: New-TssFolder -TssSession:TssSessionObject -FolderName:'A root folder' -Verbose:$True

  "folderTypeId": 1,
  "folderName": "A root folder",
  "InheritPermissions": false
}" on target "".

FolderId FolderName    FolderPath     InheritSecretPolicy InheritPermissions ParentFolderId

3        A root folder \A root folder False               False              -1
```

## Add Permissions to a Root Folder

For a folder to be of any user to your users they need to have rights to the folder. The below example will add `Group 1` with edit rights on the folder and owner rights for the secrets in the folder.

```powershell
Import-Module Thycotic.SecretServer

$sessionParams = @{
    SecretServer = 'http://prod/SecretServer'
    Credential = Get-Credential
}
$session = New-TssSession @sessionParams

$rootFolder = Search-TssFolder -TssSession $session -SearchText 'A root folder'
$group = Search-TssGroup -TssSession $session -SearchText 'Group 1'

$folderPermParams = @{
    TssSession = $session
    FolderId = $rootFolder.Id
    GroupId = $group.GroupId
    FolderAccessRoleName = 'Edit'
    SecretAccessRoleName = 'Owner'
}
New-TssFolderPermission @folderPermParams
```

### Output

```console
FolderPermissionId FolderId FolderAccessRoleName GroupName KnownAs SecretAccessRoleName Username
------------------ -------- -------------------- --------- ------- -------------------- --------
4                  3        Edit                 Group 1   Group 1 Owner
```

## Create a Child Folder

Creating a child folder is not far off of the process to create a root folder, exception is specifying the `ParentFolderId`.

```powershell
Import-Module Thycotic.SecretServer

$sessionParams = @{
    SecretServer = 'http://prod/SecretServer'
    Credential = Get-Credential
}
$session = New-TssSession @sessionParams

$rootFolder = Search-TssFolder -TssSession $session -SearchText 'A root folder'

$newFolderParams = @{
    TssSession = $session
    FolderName = 'A child folder'
    ParentFolderId = $rootFolder.Id
    InheritPermissions = $true
}
New-TssFolder @newFolderParams -Verbose
```

### Output

```console
VERBOSE: Provided command parameters: New-TssFolder -Verbose:$True -InheritPermissions:$True -ParentFolderId:3 -FolderName:'A child folder' -TssSession:TssSessionObject
VERBOSE: POST http://prod/SecretServer/api/v1/folders with:

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "POST http://prod/SecretServer/api/v1/folders with {
  "parentFolderId": 3,
  "folderTypeId": 1,

}" on target "".
VERBOSE: POST http://prod/SecretServer/api/v1/folders with 115-byte payload
VERBOSE: received 289-byte response of content type application/json
VERBOSE: Content encoding: utf-8

FolderId FolderName     FolderPath                    InheritSecretPolicy InheritPermissions ParentFolderId
-------- ----------     ----------                    ------------------- ------------------ --------------
4        A child folder \A root folder\A child folder True                True               3
```

## Create a Full Folder Structure

This example will create a folder structure loosly based on the [Secret Server Best Practices - Folder Structure](https://docs.delinea.com/secrets/current/best-practices/index.md#folder_structure).

### Folder Structure

```bash
|-- ABC Company
|   |-- Customers
|   |-- Human Resources
|   |-- Information Technology
|   |   |-- Development Services
|   |   |   |-- Programmers
|   |   |-- Technical Services
|   |   |   |-- Databases
|   |   |   |   |-- Oracle
|   |   |   |   |-- SQL Server
|   |   |   |-- Systems
|   |   |   |   |-- Network Infrastructure
|   |   |   |   |-- Unix
|   |   |   |   |-- Windows
|   |-- Vendors
|   |-- Security
```

### CSV Data

The CSV that represents the above folder structure is below, you can also download it from [examples folder].

```console
ParentFolder, ChildFolder
ABC Company, Customers
ABC Company, Human Resources
ABC Company, Information Technology
ABC Company, Vendors
ABC Company, Security
Information Technology, Development Services
Information Technology, Technical Services
Development Services, Programmers
Technical Services, Databases
Technical Services, Systems
Databases, Oracle
Databases, SQL Server
Systems, Network Infrastructure
Systems, Unix
Systems, Windows
```
